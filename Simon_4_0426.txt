Describe, if you were to continue with Arduino, what would you create?

If I was to continue with my arduino project, I would first make it a lot bigger. I would
spend a lot of time fixing the mistakes I made. As soon as I was done with that. I would
start new project, I would try to make a robot of some sort. Maybe something that can
draw, or write things down.
