Given mymap[67][43], Which is the X coordinate? How does this happen?
43 is the X coordinate, and 67 is the Y coordinate.
The array is setup so that the y is first and the x is second.
	
Write the code from line a and explain what it does.

	if(i == 0) {
	System.out.print("8888");
}

This line of code checks to see if the y of the array is equal to zero, and if it is, it
will print eights along the border.

Write the code from line b and explain what it does.

	System.out.print(map[i][j]);

This line of code will decide to print out either the x or the ".", so if the
parameters in the if statement for the x above are true, it will print an x. So
basically, it will print what it is told to print.

Write the code from line c and explain what it does.

	System.out.println(".");

This line of code will print a period and add a line in return for the next bit of
code.

Write the code from line d and explain what it does.

	System.out.println(map[i][j]);
This line of code will print the same thing as c, but the only difference is, it will
skip a line.

Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and
code example.

Explain the use of static.
The use of static is to see if the use of the variable is shared between all instances.

Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
I could use an object to make a weapon for my player.
