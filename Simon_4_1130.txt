How successful were you with your game?

I was really successful with my game because I was able to learn how to use a while
loop, and I was able to do the entire game without any help from the teacher, which
in retrospect is a huge success.

In what way? Be Specific.

I was able to succeed on this project because I learned how to incorporate many new
important Java aspects into one whole project. I learned how to use a while loop and
how to add questions.
