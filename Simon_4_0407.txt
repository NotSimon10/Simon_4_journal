I have learned many things while working with the arduino. I have learned that I can
solve problems by just putting my mind to it. I taught myself how to use the wires with
the breadboard, and now I have a finished and working project. I also learned that I can
code in many different languages. I didn't think that it would be as easy to learn as it
was, but I did realize that it was very similar to Java in many ways. The last thing I
learned was that I can do more than I think I can, I just need to put my mind to it.
