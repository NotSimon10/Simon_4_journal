Jeremy's Game:
Playability - His game could be restarted and be played up to as many times as you want.
It is a catchy game that you can play and navigate through a maze to save yourself before
time runs out. Points 7/10
Originality - His game is semi-original, the game we based our code off of was orginally
a maze, so he just remade that into his own. Points 5/10
Code Quality - His code is reasonably well done. There is a bit of old comments left in,
and some classes aren't perfect. Points 7/10
19/30
