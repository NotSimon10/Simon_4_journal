How would one check to see whether weapons damage enemies or objects in Slick?

You could do enemy.health -= 1; and if you had an integer named "health" in the enemy
class, you could subtract one from the total amount. Then, you would check to see if it 
had health remaining by doing:

if(enemy.health <= 0) {

e.isvisible = false;

}

That would make it so the enemy is no longer visible/in the game.
