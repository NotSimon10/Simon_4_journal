The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate
patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli). Memorization, the
regurgitation of facts, is considered the lowest level of learning. Why, then, are
students encouraged to learn computer science?

We are encouraged to learn computer science because it is a extremely enhanced way of
learning how to teach ourselves things. It teaches us that we need to tinker with things
and that we need to work on our own to solve our problems.

What should students learn from computer science?

We should learn that we will not always have help, and we won't always have the exact
answer online to solve our problems, so we need to fix our own problems.
