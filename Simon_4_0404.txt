I have made it so a potentiometer can be turned and change the pitch of the piezzo
buzzer.

I need to configure a bit of the code.

I will be able to turn in my arduino and code. I am going to add one more function to my 
design. (Not sure what yet.)

I am making new functions.

I have created one to be called to change the pitch.
