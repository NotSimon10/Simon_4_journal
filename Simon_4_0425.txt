We wil have an end of the year assessment.
What are 10 concepts you believe will be covered on the test. Why?
1. For Loops
2. If Statements
3. Booleans
4. Integers
5. Doubles
6. Else
7. Ask what certain parts of Java code do.
8. &&, ||, !
9. While Loops
10. Objects
I think these will be on the test because they are key in the basics of Java.
