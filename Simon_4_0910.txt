What we did with github yesterday was, we programmed files into Github. We used simple commands as in pico, to make a text document. Then we saved it and and used "git add *" to add the files to github. and then we used push to 
update the file on Github.

Step One: Type Pico (Last Name)_(Period)_(Date).txt
Step Two: Press "Ctrl X" to exit pico and save the file.
Step Three: Type "git add *" to add it to git.
Step Four: Type in the push command to add it to git.
