What is this?: 
public void render(GameContainer gc, StateBasedGame sbg, Graphics g) 
throws SlickException {

This is the render class, this causes the games output to be made so it
actually looks like a game.

Is it a class or method? How do you know?

It is a class because it is public and can be called anywhere.
