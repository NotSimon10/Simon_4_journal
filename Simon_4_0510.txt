import java.util.Random;

public class Hero {

public static final Random rand = new Random();
public static int health = 100;
public static int score = 0;
public static boolean weapon = false;
public static int dexterity = rand.nextInt(100)+1;
public static int perception = rand.nextInt(100)+1;
public static int level;
public static int x, y, z;
public static String = "@";

public Hero(int x , int y, int symbol){
	walkcycle = x;
	camera = y;
	@ = symbol;

}

}

Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name.

public class Hero {
public static int name;
Scanner Name = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("What's your name?");
name = Name.nextInt();
}

Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero?

You would have to constantly call from the class hero instead of just the main.
