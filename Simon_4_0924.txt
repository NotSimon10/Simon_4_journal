The reason that Steve Ballmer thought that the General Public License was a "Virus" is
because of the way the license is written. He says, "if you use any open source software,
you have to make the rest of your software open source." 


The difference between open source and proprietary software is that you can see the code
for open source.

The difference between GPL and MIT License is that the MIT license doesn't require open
source whereas the GPL does.
