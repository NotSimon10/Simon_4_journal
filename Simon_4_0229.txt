No, this is not a class constructor.

How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?

public class Cake {
	int layers;
	boolean isEaten;
	String icing;

public Cake(String a, int b) {
	this.icing = a;
	this.layers = b;
	this.isEaten = false;
}


//A getter gets, a getter will return values from an object.
	public boolean getisEaten() {
		return this.isEaten;
}
//A setter sets variable values for an instance.
	public void setisEaten(boolean b) {
		this.isEaten = b;
}
}

An array of Breakfast?
int[] breakfast; //This is an array of integers.
String[] bfast; //This is an array of Strings.
boolean[] [] blocked; //This is a 2D array of booleans.
Breakfast[] simonFamilyBreakfast;
Cake Josh = new Cake("Yellow", 3);

//This is using a setter:
Josh.setisEaten(true);
//This is using a getter:
Josh.getisEaten();
