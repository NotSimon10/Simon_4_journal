How can / will you make the orb move in the direction you are facing?

To make the orb move the way I am facing, I can create an integer called
"direction" and import that into our game code. We can make it so when they
press the right key, the integer will equal one, then left equals 2, up equals
3, down equals 4. Then we can make an if statement:
if(player.direction == 1) {



}
