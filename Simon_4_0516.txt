Explain casting, up-casting, down-casting.

Up-casting puts an object in a certain group, but the object itself continues to act as
its own object.
Down-casting allows the objects to seperate from a certain grouping allowing the 
properties of that object to be manipulated once more.
Casting is taking an object of one certain type and turning it into another object type.

Give a specific code example for up-casting.

Cat c = new Cat();
    System.out.println(c);
    Mammal m = c; // upcasting
    System.out.println(m);

Give a specific code example for down-casting.

Cat c1 = new Cat();		 
    Animal a = c1;		
    if(a instanceof Cat){ 
        System.out.println("It's a Cat! Now i can safely downcast it to a Cat, without a
 fear of failure.");        
        Cat c2 = (Cat)a;
    }

Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String.
String stringValueOf = String.valueOf('c');

What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127. Unsigned 128 is 10000000. Negative integers are represented in a system 
called two's complement.
