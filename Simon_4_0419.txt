Describe what similarities you notice between assembly and Human Resource Machine?

The similarities that I see between Human Resource Machine and Assembly are that there 
are jumps to jump to a certain part of the code. For example, there is a jump called an
unconditional jump, this is where you can transfer a set of instructions forwards to skip
certain parts of code, or you can turn it backwards and re-execute the code above. 

Describe what differences you notice between assembly and Human Resource Machine?

The differences that I noticed between Assembly and Human Resource Machine are that there
are many more ways of jumping in assembly than there were in the game. For example, a
conditional jump holds many diffent types of jumps as in, Jump Equal or Jump Zero, Jump
Not Equal or Jump Not Zero, Jump Greater or Jump Not Less/Equal, and many more.
