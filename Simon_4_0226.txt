What does the code below do?

The code runs for loops to check if "i" is less than or equal to the map. Then it prints
the outcome, do to the if statements.

How could you make it print an X? i.e., what array values would you change?

I have no idea how to print the X.

How could you use this to make a 5 in a row game?

You could use this to figure out what spaces have been used.
